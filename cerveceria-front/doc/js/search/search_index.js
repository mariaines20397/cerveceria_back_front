Developer.\nObjetivo\nRealizar la maquetación (HTML y CSS) y realizar la funcionalidad de filtros en Javascript del siguiente prototipo\nVer prototipo\nVer archivo de diseño\nFuncionamiento de filtros\nTener en cuenta los siguientes requerimientos para realizar la funcionalidad de los filtros:\n\nAl hacer clic en el botón de filtrar se despliega un modal con las opciones para filtrar\nSe pueden seleccionar varias opciones\nAl seleccionar una se activa el botón de limpiar y se muestra el número de opciones seleccionadas en el botón de filtrar\nAl hace clic en el botón de filtrar se cierra el modal y se muestran los productos que cumplen con los filtros seleccionados\nAl hacer clic en el botón de limpiar quita las opciones seleccionados del formulario de filtros y carga el listado con todas las opciones\nSon tres opciones de filtro: Rubia (id=1), Morena (id=2) y Roja (id=3)\n\nRequisitos técnicos\n\nDebe ser un proyecto Angular\nUsar sass para crear los estilos.\nLa aplicacion debe estar internacionalizada para Ingles y Español.\nEl frontend debera estar documentado con Compodoc.\nTodos los componentes y servicios deben tener su correspondiente Unit Test.\nDebe crear un servicio para manejo de productos, donde incluya funciones para cargar los productos, filtrarlos, etc. Este servicio debera invocarse desde el componente que renderice los productos.\nPara la construcción del listado de los productos usar el archivo products.json que esta en este repositorio, usando la libreria Handlebars.\nPara usar librerias de terceros usar CDNJS.\nUsar HTML5 y CSS3.\nPuede usar cualquier framework frontend para apoyarse en la maquetación, recomiendo Bootstrap 5.\n\nResponsive\nEl prototipo dado esta diseñado en mobile, a pesar de no tener la versión desktop debe ser responsive. Ej: en pantallas desktop el grid de productos puede cambiar a 4 columnas.\nRecursos\n\nEn la carpeta img encuentra las imagenes de los productos.\nEn la carpeta svg encuentra las iconos.\n\nBonus\nAl realizar uno o todos los puntos siguientes son puntos extras al calificar el resultado de la prueba:\n\nSi se recarga la página y se tenian filtros aplicados, estos se deben de conservar.\nPueden agregar mas filtros u otras opciones similares al menu de productos.\nAgregar otras categorias de productos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
